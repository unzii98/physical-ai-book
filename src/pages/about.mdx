# About the Author

Physical AI is the next frontier. This book aims to provide a comprehensive guide to building embodied intelligence systems, from standard ROS2 control to advanced Vision-Language-Action models.

## Vision

The gap between simulation and reality is closing. With tools like NVIDIA Isaac Sim and high-fidelity physics engines, we can train robots in the cloud and deploy them to the physical world with increasing success.

This book is built for engineers who want to cross that bridge.
